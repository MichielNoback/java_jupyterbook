# Sessions &amp; Scopes &amp; authentication

## Introduction 

In this post, some seemingly diverse topics are dealt with. After reading, you should be aware that they actually relate.

The topics are:
- application-scoped variables with web.xml
- user authentication
- sessions
- overview of the different scopes and when to use which

**DISCLAIMER  
_Everything in this presentation related to authentication is purely for the purpose of showing principles.
For real-world applications you will need to do much work on security_**

## Scopes 

The scope of things in a web app can be categorized as Page, Request, Session and Application scope. These are dealt with in the sections below.

## Application scope: web.xml

You use application-scoped variables for everything that 
relates to the entire application: admin email, database type and url, servlet configuration, etc.
**_Application-scoped variables_** are available withing servlets but also within Thymeleaf templates. These variables are defined within an xml file named `web.xml` and it is called a **_deployment descriptor_**.

### Adding a deployment descriptor

These are the steps you can take to have IntelliJ add a web.xml file in the correct location.

1. Go to Project Structure (`Cmd + ;` on Mac)
2. Facets &rarr; Web &rarr; Web Gradle (select your project)
3. Under pane Deployment Descriptors, click "+" 
4. Select "web.xml”
5. In the path, put this: `<your project root>/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml`

You’ll get something like this

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_4_0.xsd"
         version="4.0">

</web-app>
```

### Add an application-scoped variable

In `web.xml`, put the following snippet:

```xml
    <context-param>
        <param-name>admin_email</param-name>
        <param-value>admin@example.com</param-value>
    </context-param>
```

### Using the application-scoped variable

In your servlets, use the web app variable like this:

```java
getServletContext().getInitParameter("admin_email")
```

In your Thymeleaf template, the application-scoped variable, is available like this


```html
th:text="${#servletContext.getInitParameter('admin_email')}"
```

## Session scope: cross-request "memory"

A server handling your request will have no memory of your visit after it is processed.
To be able to "keep in touch" you will need to have a tracking system: we call this a session.
The most well-known session implementation system is by means of cookies.

This is a cookie according to Wikipedia: “In computing, a cookie (also tracking cookie, browser cookie, and HTTP cookie) is a small piece of text stored on a user's computer by a web browser. A cookie consists of one or more name-value pairs containing bits of information such as … the identifier for a server-based session....” 

Thus, sessions represent **_cross-request memory_**. 

Typical usages of session objects are 
- keeping an authenticated user "logged in"
- keeping track of "shopping baskets"
- keeping track of history ("here at the items you have looked at previously")

In java, sessions are usually maintained by means of a JSessionID stored as a cookie.
You will probably never create a cookie directly. You simply use this statement:
`HttpSession session = request.getSession();`


## Authentication

You do not need to have an authenticated user to create a session, but authentication is never done without using session.

There are several reasons why you would like to know who it is that requests a certain page, the main reason being that you want only authorized persons to have access (and with a certain role).

Let’s look at some sample code to create a login system using sessions.

### Login form

Here is the first element, a login form. Take notice of the form field names eg `name="username"`. These names are going to be used in the servlet to fetch the login credentials. Also note the `action="login"` attribute of the `<form>` tag. It will direct to the server requesting resource `login`.


```html
<!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "http://www.thymeleaf.org/dtd/xhtml1-strict-thymeleaf-4.dtd">

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/>
    <title>Authentication demo</title>

    <link rel="stylesheet" th:href="@{/css/main.css}" href="../../css/main.css">
</head>
<body>
<h4>Log in</h4>
<h4 th:text="${message}" th:class="${message_type}">_message_</h4>

<form action="login" method="POST">
    <label for="username_field"> User name: </label>
    <input id="username_field" type="text" name="username" required/> <br/>
    <label for="password_field"> User password: </label>
    <input id="password_field" type="password" name="password" required/><br/>
    <label class="login_field"> </label>
    <input type="submit" value="OK"/>
</form>

<h5>If you have any problems, please contact <span th:text="${#servletContext.getInitParameter('admin_email')}"></span></h5>
</body>
</html>
```

and it looks like this in the browser:

![Login form 1](figures/login_form1s.png)

<img style="float: left; margin: 10px;" src="figures/warning_64.png">

**Actually, when you see a `http://` protocol instead of an `https://` protocol in the location bar of your browser, you do NOT have safety on you connection, even though you cannot see the password in the form!**

But that issue is not within the scope of this course.

### Login servlet

This is the servlet dealing with the login form. 

```java
package nl.bioinf.wis_on_thymeleaf.servlets;

//many imports

@WebServlet(urlPatterns = "/login")
public class LoginServlet extends HttpServlet {
    private TemplateEngine templateEngine;

    @Override
    public void init() throws ServletException {
        this.templateEngine = WebConfig.getTemplateEngine();
    }

    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        String username = request.getParameter("username");
        String password = request.getParameter("password");

        WebContext ctx = new WebContext(
                request,
                response,
                request.getServletContext(),
                request.getLocale());

        //fetch the session object
        //if it is not present, one will be created
        HttpSession session = request.getSession();
        String nextPage;
        
        
        if (session.isNew() || session.getAttribute("user") == null) {
            boolean authenticated = authenticate(username, password);
            if (authenticated) {
                session.setAttribute("user", new User("Henk", "henk@example.com", Role.USER));
                nextPage = "mainSite";
            } else {
                ctx.setVariable("message", "Your password and/or username are incorrect; please try again");
                ctx.setVariable("message_type", "error");
                nextPage = "login";
            }
        } else {
            nextPage = "mainSite";
        }
        templateEngine.process(nextPage, ctx, response.getWriter());
    }

    private boolean authenticate(String username, String password) {
        return username.equals("Henk") && password.equals("henk");
    }

    //simple GET requests are immediately forwarded to the login page
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        WebContext ctx = new WebContext(
                request,
                response,
                request.getServletContext(),
                request.getLocale());
        ctx.setVariable("message", "Fill out the login form");
        ctx.setVariable("message_type", "info");
        templateEngine.process("login", ctx, response.getWriter());
    }
}
```

Above the class declaration you see the `@WebServlet(urlPatterns = "/login")` annotation which tells the application server to route all requests to the URL `/login` to this servlet class.

The `doPost()` method -which has several code smells (do you know which)- creates a session object. Next, it checks the session status and proceeds. If it is new (or empty): check user credentials. Else: go directly to the main page - why check credentials if the user already is logged in?
The `authenticate()` method is a dummy of course. We'll visit that part of authentication in the post on database interaction because -obviously- user data are stored in a database and are never hard-coded. If authentication is successful, the user is forwarded to the sites' main page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "http://www.thymeleaf.org/dtd/xhtml1-strict-thymeleaf-4.dtd">

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/>
    <title>_TITLE_</title>

</head>
<body>
    <h3>Welcome to our main page, [[${session.user.name}]]! Feel free to browse our content</h3>
</body>
</html>
```

The `[[${session.user.name}]]!` expression is an inline text expression - it does not need to be embedded in a html tag.

Alternatively, we could have used this:

```html
    <h3>Welcome to our main page, <span th:text="${session.user.name}">__offline__</span>! Feel free to browse our content</h3>
```

### Test

Start the server and run
- Log in
- Enter username and password
- Test false credentials 
- Test correct credentials

What is the result, what do you see?
Can you detect weaknesses and/or improve on the design?


## Summary of scopes

As in all programming environments, scopes are really important  in web applications.
We have seen the three main ones: 

### Application scope

Specified in `web.xml` and accessed through 
`${#servletContext.getInitParameter('admin_email')}` in the Thymeleaf files or `getServletContext().getInitParameter("<attrib_name>")` in the servlet code

### Session scope

Stored in `HttpSession` object. When available, accessed through
`${session.<attrib_name>}` in the Thymeleaf files and 
`getSession.getAttribute("<attrib_name>")` in the servlet code. Set through `getSession.setAttribute("<attrib_name>", <attrib>)`.

### "Request" scope

Each http request generates its own `HttpRequest` object. 
It can be accessed through `${#request.<attrib_name>}` in the Thymeleaf files. In servlet context, use `request.getParameter("<attrib_name>")` to get it or `request.setAttribute("<attrib_name>", "<attrib>")` to set it.
The `WebContext` object is of course used much more in Thymeleaf, and in that context simply accessed as `${attrib_name>}`
