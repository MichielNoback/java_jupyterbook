# Arrays

Arrays are ordered collections of variables of the same type. 
These elements can by any valid Java type: primitives, 
object references, or even null values.

These variables are not individually named and managed, but collectively.

In real life, you donâ€™t use arrays too much because other types (ArrayList) 
are often more convenient because _arrays can't be extended or shortened_ and 
don't have all those nice helper methods that ArrayList has 
(see the [collections post](/03_apis/collections)). However, arrays 
certainly have their use when (memory) efficiency is an issue, or when you want 
to go multidimensional.

:::{admonition} Arrays have fixed length
:class: warning

Arrays keep the size they have at the time you create them.
Don't use arrays if you need collections that need to shrink or grow: use `ArrayList` or other collection types.

Of course, as seen in a previous chapter, the String array `String[] args` is the entry point of outside arguments into any Java program:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    for(int i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
        System.out.println("argument " + i + " is " + args[i]);
    }
}
```


## Creating arrays

To create an array, you have to specify what type it will hold, and how many elements
it will hold. This can be done via:

1. passing the size as a "constructor" argument
2. declaring a literal

Here are both ways for primitives and reference type elements.

```java
//create by specifying size - will contain zeros
int[] numbers = new int[5];
//create by specifying contents
double[] scores = {2.1, 3.0, 4.5, 5.6};
//create by specifying size - will contain nulls
Cell[] cells1 = new Cell[6];
//create by specifying contents
Cell[] cells2 = {new Cell(), new Cell(), new Cell()};
```

Note that when only the size is specified, the array will be filled with the type's **_default value_**, 
which is:

- `false` for `boolean`
- `u0000` for `char`
- 0 or 0.0 for numeric types (`byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`)
- `null` for reference types

An array of primitives will actually contain the primitive values.

An array of objects will hold the references to the objects, not the objects themselves

```{image} figures/array_3.png
:alt: an array of objects
:width: 300px

```

## Printing

If you want to print an entire array, use the method `Arrays.toString()`:

```java
System.out.println("bytes = " + Arrays.toString(bytes));
```

## Accessing

To get to an element of an array, you use an index. Java array indexing starts at zero.

```{image} figures/array_1.png
:alt: an array of objects
:width: 300px
:align: center
```

```java
int[] numbers = new int[7];
numbers[0] = 42;
numbers[4] = 22;
```

```{image} figures/array_2.png
:alt: an array of objects
:width: 300px
:align: center
```

Arrays are often created and accessed using a for loop:

```java
Cell[] cells = new Cell[number];
for(int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
	cells[i] = new Cell();
}
```

Or, if you like, the new post-Java-8 way:

```java
int size = 10;
Cell[] cells = new Cell[size];
IntStream.range(0, size)
    .forEach(n -> cells[n] = new Cell());
System.out.println("cells = " + Arrays.toString(cells));
```

## Multidimensional arrays

Multidimensional arrays have their use. Usually with numeric settings. You can up the number of dimensions way into the hypothetical realm. Here is an example of a two-dimensional one:

```java
final int sideLength = 5;
//creates 5*5 array
int[][] scoreBoard = new int[sideLength][sideLength];
for (int i = 0; i < sideLength ; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < sideLength; j++) {
        scoreBoard[i][j] = i*j;
    }
}

for (int i = 0; i < sideLength ; i++) {
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(scoreBoard[i]));
}
```

will output:

<pre class="console_out">
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
[0, 3, 6, 9, 12]
[0, 4, 8, 12, 16]
</pre>
